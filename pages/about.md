Hi, my name is Bing Zong, I am a software engineer. 

Over the years, I realized that studying for technical interviews always involved revising back computer science fundamentals. This has always led to scambling back on old notes or books to find these information. Thus I have decided to create a place to store these information, and that is how this website came about.
