## STAR method
- STAR is a way to format your response to behavioral questions.
- STAR stands for Situation, Task, Action, Result.
- Situation: Describe the situation and context.
- Task: What were the task.
- Action: What actions did you take.
- Result: What were the outcome.

## Misc
- Highlight accomplishments but use facts and data to make it impressive.
- Interviewer might not know how challenging/impressive an accomplishment might be. Make your answers simple and concise. Offer the interviewer to drill in further if they wish to.
- Remember to focus on yourself. Make it very clear on what was it that you have done. Use "I" instead of "We".
