# Linked List
This page contains algorithms relating to linked list.

## Runner Technique
- The runner technique means iterating through the linked list with two pointers simultaneously, with one ahead of the other.
- For example, 
  - The "slow" pointer could iterate through the list, element by element.
  - The "fast" pointer could be ahead of the slow pointer by a fixed amount while iterating, or hopping multiple nodes for each iteration in the "slow" node.
