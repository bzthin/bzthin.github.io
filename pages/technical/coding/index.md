# Coding Interview
This page contains coding interview information. 

## Steps to solving coding problems
- Gather requirements/Clarify the question: 
  - Listen to the interviewer question. 
  - Ask questions to gather requirements and clarify to understand the question.
- Use concrete examples: 
  - Create examples to the question to verify understanding of their input and output. 
  - Try to have specific and sufficiently large example to cover most cases.
- Brute force: 
  - Come up with the brute force approach as the starting line. 
  - Explain time complexity and space complexity to use for comparison.
- Optimize: 
  - Optimize brute force solution 
  - Explain time complexity and space complexity of how is the optimized method better.
  - If stuck, try to apply patterns or use different data structures.
- Walkthrough: 
  - Walk through optimized solution approach in details with an example to ensure it fits the requirements, solves the problem and covered all edge cases. 
- Implement: 
  - Implement the code. Remember to make your code modular, clean and includes error checks.
- Test: 
  - Test your code with an example. 
  - Do not simply start off with a large example as that will take too long. 
  - Go through the code first, line by line to verify concept, check for errors, etc.
  - Test the code with a small example.
  - Test the code with special cases like empty array etc.
