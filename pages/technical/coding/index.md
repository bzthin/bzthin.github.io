# Coding Interview
This page contains coding interview information. 

## Steps to solving coding problems
- Gather requirements: 
  - Listen to the interviewer question. 
  - Ask questions to gather requirements.
- Use examples: 
  - Create examples to the question to verify understanding of their input and output. 
  - Try to have specific and sufficiently large example to cover most cases.
- Brute force: 
  - Come up with the brute force approach as the starting line. 
  - Explain time complexity and space complexity to use for comparison.
- Optimize: 
  - Optimize brute force solution 
  - Explain time complexity and space complexity of how is the optimized method better.
- Walk through: 
  - Walk through optimized solution approach in details with an example to ensure it fits the requirements, solves the problem and covered all edge cases. 
- Implement: 
  - Implement the code. Remember to make your code modular, clean and includes error checks.
- Test: 
  - Test your code with an example. 
  - Do not simply start off with a large example as that will take too long. 
  - Go through the code first, line by line to verify concept, check for errors, etc.
  - Test the code with a small example.
  - Test the code with special cases like empty array etc.

## Core data structures and algorithms. 
Consider implementing these from scratch to really understand them.
- Data Structures  
  - Linked Lists 
  - Trees, Tries, & Graphs  
  - Stacks & Queues  
  - Heaps 
  - Vectors I ArrayLists  
  - Hash Tables

- Algorithms
  - Breadth-First Search
  - Depth-First Search
  - Binary Search
  - Merge Sort
  - QuickSort

- Concepts
  - Bit Manipulation
  - Memory (Stack vs. Heap)
  - Recursion
  - Dynamic Programming
  - Big O Time & Space
