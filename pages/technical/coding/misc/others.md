## Concepts
### Object Oriented Programming
- SOLID principles
- S - Single responsibility principle: A class should have only one job.  
- O - Open closed principle: Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- L - Liskov substitution principle: Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.
- I - Interface segregation principle: Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface. A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
- D - Dependency inversion principle: Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.

### Polymorphism
- Typically, polymorphism occurs when there is a hierarchy of classes and they are related by inheritance.
- C++ polymorphism means that a call to a member function will cause a different function to be executed depending on the type of object that invokes the function.

### Virtual inheritance
- Virtual inheritance is a C++ technique that ensures only one copy of a base class's member variables are inherited by grandchild derived classes.
