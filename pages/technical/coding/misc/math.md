# Math
This page contains Math information. Here are some common math that is sometimes required in algorithms or deriving time complexity.

## Series
- Summation of 1 to n: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (n-1) + n = n/2 * (n+1) = n(n+1)/2.

## Discrete Math
- TBD

### Permutation
- Permutation: n permute k = n! / (n-k)!

### Combination
- Combination: n choose k = n! / k!(n-k)!

## Linear Algebra
### Cross product
TBD

### Dot product
TBD


## Greatest common divisor
TBD
