# Graphs
This page contains trees and graphs algorithms. 

## Graph algorithms (TBD) 
- TBD (Distance, search, connectivity, cycle-detection etc)
- 3 basic ways to represent graph in memory (object and pointers, matrix, and adjacency list) and their pros and cons
- Basic graph traversal algorithms, BFS, DFS.
