# System Design
Usually no right answers and will be more discussion based. You should drive the conversation.

## Steps
- Understand the question. Ask questions about the question.
- Understand broadly but start scoping the problem to know what interviewer wants
- State assumptions clearly.
- Start drawing the major components without going too deep. Walk through end to end flow.
- Identify the issues, bottlenecks and challenges. 
- Ask interviewer which area specifically to dive deep in
- Suggest solutions and evaluate pros and cons.

## Key concepts
- Horizontal vs vertical scaling
- Load balancer
- Database denormalization and NoSQL
- Database partitioing (sharding)
  - Vertical partitioning
  - key-based (or hash based partitioning)
  - Directory-based partitioning
- Caching
- Asynchronous processing & queues
- Networking metrics
  - Bandwidth
  - Throughput
  - Latency
- Map reduce

## Considerations
- Failures/Exceptions
- Availability and reliability 
- Read heavy vs write heavy
- Security
