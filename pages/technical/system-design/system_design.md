## System Design Interview
- A system design interview is a type of technical interview where candidates are asked to design scalable and efficient software systems to solve real-world problems. 
- Unlike coding interviews, system design has no right or wrong answers thus to do well, we should understand how are system design interviews evaluated

## General points of evaluation
1. Navigate ambuiguity.
  - Asks questions or communicate assumptions to understand the problem requirements and edge cases.
  - Understands the entire problem or go beyond the obvious use/edge cases.
2. Create scalable designs
  - Able to create scalable designs that considers availability and reliability as well for estimated users.
  - Understands bottlenecks and can provide solutions without over engineering.
  - Components have clear responsibilities and boundaries, interactions between them are well defiend.
3. Consider alternatives and tradeoffs. 
  - We should be able to evaluate different solutions/tools pros and cons and explain our decision for the specific problem with justifications.
4. Operational Excellence.
  - Considers OE factors in their solution such as logging, monitoring, tests, infrastructure as code and CI/CD.
