## Authentication
- Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or entity attempting to access a system or resource.

## Authorization
- Authorization is the process of determining what actions or resources a user is allowed to access after they have been authenticated.

## OAuth
- OAuth (Open Authorization) is an open standard for token-based authentication and authorization.
- It is primarily used for delegated authorization, allowing one application (the client) to access resources on behalf of another application (the resource owner) without sharing credentials.

## JWT
- JWT is a compact, self-contained format for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
- It is commonly used as a token format for representing claims between two parties, such as an identity provider and a client application.
