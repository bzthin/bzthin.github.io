## Framework
- 4-step process for effective system design interview

## Step 1 - Understand the problem and establish design scope
- Important to understand the requirements and clarify ambiguities

## Step 2 - Propose high-level design and get buy-in
- Aim to develop a high-level design and reach an agreement with the interviewer on the design

## Step 3 - Design deep dive
- At this step, you and your interviewer should have already achieved the following objectives:
  - Agreed on the overall goals and feature scope
  - Sketched out a high-level blueprint for the overall design
  - Obtained feedback from your interviewer on the high-level design
  - Had some initial ideas about areas to focus on in deep dive based on her feedback
- You shall work with the interviewer to identify and prioritize components in the architecture.

## Step 4 - Wrap up
- In this final step, the interviewer might ask you a few follow-up questions or give you the
freedom to discuss other additional points.
- The interviewer might want you to identify the system bottlenecks and discuss potential
improvements. Never say your design is perfect and nothing can be improved. There is
always something to improve upon. This is a great opportunity to show your critical
thinking and leave a good final impression.
- It could be useful to give the interviewer a recap of your design. This is particularly
important if you suggested a few solutions. Refreshing your interviewerâ€™s memory can be
helpful after a long session.
- Error cases (server failure, network loss, etc.) are interesting to talk about.
- Operation issues are worth mentioning. How do you monitor metrics and error logs?
How to roll out the system?
- How to handle the next scale curve is also an interesting topic. For example, if your
current design supports 1 million users, what changes do you need to make to support 10
million users?
- Propose other refinements you need if you had more time.

## Time allocation on each step
- System design interview questions are usually very broad, and 45 minutes or an hour is not
enough to cover the entire design. Time management is essential. How much time should you
spend on each step? The following is a very rough guide on distributing your time in a 45-
minute interview session. Please remember this is a rough estimate, and the actual time
distribution depends on the scope of the problem and the requirements from the interviewer.
- Step 1 Understand the problem and establish design scope: 3 - 10 minutes
- Step 2 Propose high-level design and get buy-in: 10 - 15 minutes
- Step 3 Design deep dive: 10 - 25 minutes
- Step 4 Wrap: 3 - 5 minutes
