# Interview Lifecycle
This page contains interview lifecycle information.

These are the general steps during an interview process:
1. Job market research
2. Resume and application
3. Phone screen interview
4. Onsite interview
5. Offer negotiations

## 1) Job market research
- Research about the companies that you are interested in and ideally find people you know at these companies.


## 2) Resume and application
- Prepare your resume that is tailored to the job and submit it via a personal contact (preferred), or through the company application portal.


## 3) Phone screen interview
- Perform an initial phone screening interview where often is a session over the phone or video chat.
- Typically involves a coding challenge for software engineers to filter out weak candidates from reaching onsite.


## 4) Onsite interview
- Series of interviews onsite at the company. Typically consist of coding, system design and behavioral rounds.


## 5) Offer negotiations
- Do your homework on what is considered a competitive compensation in that city or company.
- Best if you have multiple competing offers to use for negotiations with companies.
