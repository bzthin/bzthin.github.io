# Resume
This page contains resume information.

## Construction
- Consider using LaTeX to simplify resume building. It saves time + its reusable + it will be well formatted. Spend your time brushing up your skills instead.
- Example online LaTex editor like [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com).

## Length
- Strongly advised to keep to 1 page. Unless you have over 10 years of experience.

## Employment
- Include only relevant positions that makes you a more impressive candidate.
- State accomplishments instead of responsibilities.
- Use "Accomplished X by implementing Y which led to Z" format. Use numbers and measurable data to show impact.

## Skills
- List only relevant skills (software/languages). Save valuable space on your resume.
- Listing every language you have worked with is dangerous. Either list most familiar ones or include experience level in each language. I.e C++(proficient), Java(familiar).
